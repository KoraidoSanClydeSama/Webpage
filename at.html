The birds have left their trees
<br>The light pours onto me
<br>I can feel you lying there all on your own
<br>We got here the hard way
<br>All those words that we exchange
<br>Is it any wonder things get broke?
<br>
<br>Cause in my heart and in my head
<br>I'll never take back the things I said
<br>So high above, I feel it coming down
<br>She said, in my heart and in my head
<br>Tell me why this has to end
<br>Oh, no, oh, no
<br>
<br>I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall
<br>We built this town on shaky ground
<br>I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no
<br>We built it up to pull it down
<br>
<br>Now all the birds have fled
<br>The hurt just leaves me scared
<br>Losing everything I've ever known
<br>It's all become too much
<br>Maybe I'm not built for love
<br>If I knew that I could reach you, I would go
<br>
<br>It's in my heart and in my head
<br>You can't take back the things you said
<br>So high above, I feel it coming down
<br>She said, in my heart and in my head
<br><br>Tell me why this has to end
<br>Oh, no, oh, no
<br>
<br>I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall
<br>We built this town on shaky ground
<br>I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no
<br>We built it up to pull it down
<br>
<br>And we build it up and we build it up
<br>And we build it up to pull it down
<br>And we build it up and we build it up
<br>And we build it up to pull it down
<br>
<br>I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall
<br>We built this town on shaky ground
<br>I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no
<br>We built it up to pull it down
