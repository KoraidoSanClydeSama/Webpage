If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
<br>We would pop champagne and raise a toast
<br>To all of the queens who are fighting alone
<br>Baby, you're not dancin' on your own
<br>
<br>Can't live without me, you wanna' but you can't, nah-nah-nah
<br>Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
<br>I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
<br>I'll show you how a real queen behaves, oh
<br>
<br>No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
<br>Once I start breathin' fire, you can't tame me
<br>And you might think I'm weak without a sword
<br>But if I had one, it'd be bigger than yours
<br>
<br>If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
<br>We would pop champagne and raise a toast
<br>To all of the queens who are fighting alone
<br>Baby, you're not dancin' on your own
<br>
<br>Disobey me, then baby, it's off with your head
<br>Gonna' change it and make it a world you won't forget
<br>No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
<br>Once I start breathin' fire, you can't tame me
<br>And you might think I'm weak without a sword
<br>But I'm stronger than I ever was before
<br>
<br>If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
<br>We would pop champagne and raise a toast
<br>To all of the queens who are fighting alone
<br>Baby, you're not dancin' on your own
<br>
<br>In chess, the king can move one space at a time
<br>But queens are free to go wherever they like
<br>You get too close, you'll get a royalty high
<br>So breathe it in to feel alive
<br>
<br>If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
<br>We would pop champagne and raise a toast
<br>To all of the queens who are fighting alone
<br>Baby, you're not dancin' on your own
<br>
<br>OH-OH-OH-OH
<br>OH-OH-OH-OH
<br>OH-OH-OH-OH
<br>OH-OH-OH-OH
