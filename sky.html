'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
<br>I'm gonna give you my heart
<br>'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
<br>'Cause you light up the path
<br>
<br>I don't care, go on and tear me apart
<br>I don't care if you do, ooh-ooh, ooh
<br>'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
<br>I think I saw you
<br>
<br>'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
<br>I wanna die in your arms, oh, oh-oh
<br>'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
<br>I'm gonna give you my heart, oh
<br>I don't care, go on and tear me apart
<br>I don't care if you do, ooh-ooh, ooh
<br>'Cause in a sky, 'cause in sky full of stars
<br>I think I see you
<br>I think I see you
<br>
<br>'Cause you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars
<br>Such a heavenly view
<br>You're such a heavenly view
<br>Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
